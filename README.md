# 🗓️ Student Calendar: The Ultimate Procrastination Tool!

Welcome to **The Student Calendar** – the app that helps you pretend you're organized, while still mastering the fine art of last-minute assignments, surprise deadlines, and "Wait, that exam's tomorrow?!" moments. 🎉

## What Does It Do? 🤔
You know how sometimes you write all your deadlines and to-dos on random scraps of paper or rely on your "mental notes"? Yeah, we fixed that. The **Student Calendar** lets you:

- Add events, deadlines, and reminders (not that you'll check them 🤷).
- Feel like you've got your life together (sort of).
- Click around aimlessly when you're trying to avoid actual studying.
- Look productive in front of your friends. "Oh, sorry, I can't hang out... I have to put something in my calendar." (No one needs to know it's blank).

## Features 🚀
- **Today’s Date**: Because we know you're usually like, "Wait, what day is it again?"
- **Add Event**: For all those exciting things like "Cry Over Midterms" and "Binge-Watch Netflix".
- **Event Reminders**: So you can finally remember when that 12-hour essay marathon begins. Spoiler alert: It's in 3 hours.

## Why You'll Love It 💖
- It's **super easy to use** – like, even easier than pretending you have a life.
- You can add events, then forget about them like the champ you are.
- It's FREE (because we know you're a broke student like the rest of us).

## Why You *Really* Need This
Have you ever:

- Forgotten an assignment until the night before? (Duh)
- Missed a deadline because you thought it was next week? (Of course)
- Cried in the library because everything's due at once? (Obviously)

If you answered "yes" to any (or all) of these questions, you need this calendar more than you need caffeine during finals week.

## Warning ⚠️
**Bold Reminder:** This is JUST a part of a **bigger shit**! 🤯 You think this calendar is cool? Just wait till you see what else we’ve got cooking. This is only the beginning of a much more chaotic, potentially life-saving project. Or... it might just be more chaos, who knows? Stay tuned! 👀
